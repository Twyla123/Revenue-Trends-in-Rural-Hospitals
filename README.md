# Revenue Trends in Rural Hospitals (1995-2023)

## Overview
This project, conducted in collaboration with Professor Glenn Melnick, analyzes revenue trends among rural hospitals over a 28-year period from 1995 to 2023. The research focuses on understanding the financial challenges these hospitals face, particularly the significant shift in revenue sources from inpatient to outpatient services and the increasing reliance on Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funding to sustain hospitals serving low-income populations.

## Features

### Key Contributions/Findings:
- **Revenue Analysis:**
  - Conducted a longitudinal analysis of revenue trends in rural hospitals, with a focus on Gross Outpatient and Inpatient Percentages.
  - Explored the increasing dependence on outpatient services, which grew from **43% in 1995 to 67% in 2023**.

- **Case Mix Index, Long-Term Care Beds, and Patient Structures:**
  - Analyzed trends in case mix index to assess the complexity and diversity of patient cases handled by rural hospitals over time.
  - Evaluated the number of long-term care beds to better understand service availability and capacity in rural hospitals.
  - Investigated changes in patient structures, focusing on shifts in demographics and care needs.

- **DSH Funding and Rural Hospitals:**
  - Examined the proportion of rural hospitals classified as Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH), which increased from **18.99% in 1995 to 48.28% in 2023**,
  - Highlighted the critical role of DSH funding in supporting hospitals serving economically disadvantaged populations.

- **Hospital Decline and Financial Challenges:**
  - Analyzed the declining number of rural hospitals, which dropped from **79 in 1995 to 58 in 2023**, emphasizing the financial pressures faced by rural hospitals.

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes information on general acute care rural hospitals and consists of 13 key variables:
- Facility identifiers
- Bed sizes
- Patient care metrics (e.g., case mix index)
- Number of differnent types of beds (e.g., long-term care beds)
- Financial indicators such as Gross Outpatient and Inpatient Percentages
- ....

The data provides comprehensive insights into revenue trends, hospital classifications, patient demographics, and financial stability across rural hospitals over nearly three decades.
